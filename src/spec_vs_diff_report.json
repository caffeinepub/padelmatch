  "summary": "The diff implements the requested frontend-only fix by (1) switching Discover filter Select values to stable string keys with mapping back to backend Level types, (2) wiring the Discover screen to use these keys while still producing a typed filters object for useDiscoverCandidates(filters), and (3) adding an inline error boundary inside the Sheet content with a close action to prevent a full-screen white crash if rendering fails.",

    {
      "description": "Adds a \"Reintentar\" (Retry) button in the inline sheet error state, which was not explicitly requested (only an inline error message and a way to close were required).",
      "reason": "REQ-3 acceptance criteria mention an inline error message and a way to close the sheet; retry behavior is extra beyond the stated minimum recovery requirement.",
