  "summary": "Most performance-focused requirements are implemented: a lightweight startup shell replaces a blocking spinner during critical auth/profile gating; non-initial screens are lazy-loaded with an inline fallback; message notification polling is deferred; and dev-only startup performance instrumentation is added. React Query is tuned at least for key queries, but the diff does not clearly show global React Query default option tuning (e.g., QueryClient defaultOptions). Some unrelated product/UI/branding changes are described in frontend-file-summaries.txt without being requested.",

      "reason": "The diff shows per-query tuning for at least the profile queries (staleTime/retry/refetchOnMount), but it does not provide evidence of setting global React Query defaults (e.g., QueryClient defaultOptions) as explicitly requested.",
